### End of Semester Retrospective

In taking this course, I gained a variety of different skills that I will further utilize into my programming career. One of the primary skills I learned is the ability to process and analyze data effectively. This involved gaining proficiency in tools and techniques such as data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis. Additionally, the course helped me learn to program in popular languages such as R and Python, which are commonly used for machine learning tasks. Learning R specifically was useful as this was the first time I had ever used the program through my time in university and I feel as if itâ€™s the best language to tackle data analysis. I also learned how to find and present data in a meaningful way, enabling me to effectively communicate insights and findings to my peers. By mastering these skills, I am better equipped to pursue a career in machine learning and data science. 

Machine learning is an ever expanding field that is constantly changing. It is exciting to be involved in it and learning of all the new technologies being developed in the field. This is definitely the primary area of interest I want to be involved with when I start my career pursuit. It feels as if any problem encountered in the real world can be solved in some way using these advances in technology and I want to be involved in it.
